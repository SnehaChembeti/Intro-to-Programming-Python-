# COMMENTING - to say what actually the piece of code is doing
# symbol - (#) 


# ARITHMETIC

# Addition (+), Substraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Exponent(**)
print(((1 + 3) * (9 - 2) / 2) ** 2) #Follows pedmas rule (dm - left to right and as - left to right)


# VARIABLES
test_var = 4 + 5
print(test_var)
#can't have spaces
#can only include letters, numbers and underscores
#have to start with a letter or underscore
#Then, to create the variable, you need to use = to assign the value that you want it to have.


# MANIPULATING VARIABLES
# You can always change the value assigned to a variable by overriding the previous value.
my_var = 3

my_var = 100

# USING MULTIPLE VARIABLES
num_years = 4
days_per_year = 365 
hours_per_day = 24
mins_per_hour = 60
secs_per_min = 60
total_secs = secs_per_min * mins_per_hour * hours_per_day * days_per_year * num_years

# DEBUGGING
# One common error when working with variables is to accidentally introduce typos - NameError
